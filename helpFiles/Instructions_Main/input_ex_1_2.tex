The example below shows how to use the HyEQ solver to simulate a bouncing ball.

\begin{example}{bouncing ball with Lite HyEQ Solver}
\label{ex:bblite} Consider the hybrid system model for the bouncing ball with data given in \IfSAE{Example~1.1 in the instructions file}{Example~\ref{ex:bb}}.

For this example, we consider the ball to be bouncing on a floor at zero height. The constants for the bouncing ball system are $\gamma = 9.81$ and $\lambda=0.8$.
The following procedure is used to simulate this example in the Lite HyEQ Solver:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inside the MATLAB script {\tt run.m}, initial conditions, simulation horizons, a rule for jumps, ode solver options, and a step size coefficient are defined. The function {\tt HyEQsolver.m} is called in order to run the simulation, and a script for plotting solutions is included.
\item Then the MATLAB functions {\tt f.m, C.m, g.m, D.m} are edited according to the data given above.
\item Finally, the simulation is run by clicking the run button in {\tt run.m} or by calling {\tt run.m} in the MATLAB command window.
\end{itemize}

A solution to the bouncing ball system from 
$x(0,0)=[1,0]^\top$ and with 
$TSPAN = [0 \hspace{2mm} 10], JSPAN = [0 \hspace{2mm} 20]$, $rule =1$, 
is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:lite-1} (height) 
and Figure~\ref{fig:lite-2} (velocity).  
Both the projection onto $t$ and $j$ are shown. 
Figure~\ref{fig:lite-3} depicts the corresponding hybrid arc for the position state.
