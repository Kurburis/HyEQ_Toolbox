\begin{abstract}
This note describes the Hybrid Equations (HyEQ) Toolbox implemented in 
\matlab{} and Simulink for the simulation of hybrid dynamical systems. 
This toolbox is capable of simulating individual and interconnected 
hybrid systems where multiple hybrid systems are connected and interact 
such as a bouncing ball on a moving platform, fireflies synchronizing their flashing, and more. 
The Simulink implementation includes four basic blocks that define the dynamics of a hybrid system. 
These include a flow map, flow set, jump map, and jump set. The flows and jumps of the system are 
computed by the integrator system which is comprised of blocks that compute the continuous dynamics 
of the hybrid system, trigger jumps, update the state of the system and simulation time at jumps, 
and stop the simulation. 

\section{MATLAB-based Hybrid Equation Simulator}
\label{sec:litesolver}
One way to simulate hybrid systems is to use 
ODE function calls with events in \matlab{}. 
Such an implementation gives fast simulation of a hybrid system.

\needsupdate{
In the \matlab{}-based HyEQ solver, four basic functions are 
used to define the {\em data} of the hybrid system $\HS$
as in \eqref{eqn:HS} (without inputs):
\begin{itemize}
\item The flow map is defined in the \matlab{} function {\tt
f.m}. The input to this function is a vector with components 
defining the state of the system $x$. Its output is the value of the flow map $f$.
\item The flow set is defined in the \matlab{} function {\tt
C.m}. The input to this function is a vector with components 
defining the state of the system $x$. Its output is equal to $1$ 
if the state belongs to the set $C$ or equal to $0$ otherwise.
\item The jump map is defined in the \matlab{} function {\tt
g.m}. Its input is a vector with components defining the state of the system $x$. 
Its output is the value of the jump map $g$.
\item The jump set is defined in the \matlab{} function {\tt
D.m}. Its input is a vector with components defining the state of the system $x$. 
Its output is equal to $1$ if the state belongs to $D$ or equal to $0$ otherwise.
\end{itemize}
}

Our \matlab{}-based HyEQ Simulator uses a main function {\tt run.m} to initialize, run, 
and plot solutions for the simulation, functions {\tt f.m, C.m, g.m,} and {\tt D.m} 
to implement the data of the hybrid system, and {\tt HyEQsolver.m} 
which will solve the differential equations by integrating the continuous dynamics, 
$\dot{x}=f(x)$, and jumping by the update law $x^+ = g(x)$. 
The ODE solver called in {\tt HyEQsolver.m} initially uses the initial or most recent step size, 
and after each integration, the algorithms in {\tt HyEQsolver.m} check to see 
if the solution is in the set $C$, $D$, or neither. 
Depending on which set the solution is in, 
the simulation is accordingly reset following the dynamics given in $f$ or $g$, 
or the simulation is stopped. 
This implementation is fast because it also does not store variables to the workspace 
and only uses built-in ODE function calls.

Time and jump horizons are set for the simulation using {\tt TSPAN = [TSTART TFINAL]} 
as the time interval of the simulation and {\tt JSPAN = [JSTART JSTOP]} 
as the interval for the number of discrete jumps allowed. 
The simulation stops when either the time or jump horizon, 
i.e., the final value of either interval, 
is reached.

\subsection{Solver Function}

%\ricardo{Perhaps add some text here to briefly describe what the functions implement?}

The solver function {\tt HyEQsolver} solves the hybrid system using 
three different functions as shown below. 
First, the flows are calculated using the built-in ODE solver function {\tt ODE45} in \matlab{}. 
If the solution leaves the flow set {\tt C}, the discrete event is detected using 
the function {\tt zeroevents} as shown in Section \ref{sec:eventsdetection}. When the state jumps, 
the next value of the state is calculated via the jump map {\tt g} using the function {\tt jump} 
as shown in Section \ref{sec:jumpmap}.\\
